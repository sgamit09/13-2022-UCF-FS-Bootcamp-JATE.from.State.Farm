## Usage

**User Story**

```md
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
Read Coding, Real Savings
```

This program combines our knowledge of webpack and PWA to create a text editor app called JATE that can be installed on our computers and used offline. How happy am I that this program is working and deployed, happier than a camel on hump day.
